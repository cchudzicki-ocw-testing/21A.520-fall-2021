#### Papers and Video Presentations

Students will be responsible for four short papers and one final paper.

Students will also be responsible for video presentations to accompany each paper. These can simply provide a short synopsis or précis of the paper’s argument or take a more fun and imaginative form. It’s ok to include slides or images, but more than anything, I want to see your faces!

Paper 1: Science Autoethnography

How does your relationship with science define who you are? Rather than answer in the abstract, you may want to narrate a particularly illustrative story or experience.  (1-2 pages double spaced)

This paper is due during session 3.
